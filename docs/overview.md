# Overview

BookingHub is a backend system designed to manage reservations for shared resources such as gym classes,
rooms or similar facilities.

The system provides a REST API that allows users to authenticate, view availability and create bookings,
while administrators can manage resources and schedules.

This repository focuses exclusively on the backend and does not include a frontend client.
